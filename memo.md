SUBJECT: Internal IT Audit Findings and Recommendations

Dear Colleagues,

Please review the following information regarding the Botium Toys internal audit scope, goals, critical findings, summary and recommendations.

**Scope:**

The systems in scope are: accounting, end point detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information event management (SIEM) tool. They will be evaluated for:
* Current user permissions
* Current implementation of controls
* Current procedures and protocols


**Goals:**
* Adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Cybersecurity Framework (“NIST CSF”)
* Establish better process for systems to ensure compliance
* Fortify system controls
* Implementation of least permissions for user credential management
* Establish NIST CSF policies and procedures including their playbooks
* Ensure Botium Toys meets compliance

**Critical findings (must be addressed immediately):** 

In order to meet the audit goals, several controls need to be implemented as soon as possible:

* Least privilege
* Disaster Recovery plan
* Password policy
* Access control policy
* Account management policy
* Separation of duties
* Intrusion detections system (“IDS”)
* Encryption
* Backups 
* Password management system
* Antivirus (“AV”) software
* Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention for legacy systems
* Closed-circuit television (“CCTV”) surveillance
* Locks
* Fire detection and prevention system

Policies must be created and implemented to comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”) and the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).

Policies must be created and implemented to comply with the guidelines provided by System and Organization Controls type 1 (“SOC1”) and System and Organization Controls type 2 (“SOC2”) in regards to user access policy and data safety.

**Findings (should be addressed, but no immediate need):**

To further meet the audit goals and strengthen organizational security, additional controls should be implemented when feasible:
* Adequate lighting
* Designated indicating alarm service provider
* Time-controlled safe

**Summary/Recommendations:**

The critical findings regarding compliance with the PCI DSS and the GDPR should be addressed as soon as possible as Botium Toys takes credit card payments online and from customers in the E.U. as well. Moreover, SOC1 and SOC2 guidance related to user access policies and data safety should be used to create policies and procedures.

Disaster recovery plans and backups are also critical for ensuring business continuity in the face of a natural disaster or incident. Furthermore, integrating an IDS and AV software will better protect technical assets and data, especially given that Botium Toys currently uses legacy systems that require manual monitoring and intervention. 

In order to physically secure the assets at Botium Toys, locks and a CCTV system should be implemented to protect, monitor, and deter potential threats. 

Lastly, to build upon the security foundation, Botium Toys should pursue the use and implementation of: a time-controlled safe, adequate lighting, locking cabinets, fire detection and prevention systems, signage indicating the use of an alarm service provider, and encryption as soon as feasible.
